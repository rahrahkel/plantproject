      <h2>Watering Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Watering is one of the most important parts of plant care — and one of the easiest to get wrong.
        Many beginners assume plants need water on a strict schedule, but the truth is: it depends on the plant,
        the season, the pot size, and even the room’s temperature and humidity.
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the soil first:</strong> Stick your finger about 1 inch into the soil. If it’s dry, it’s time to water. If it’s still moist, wait a few days.</li>
        <li><strong>Water deeply:</strong> When you do water, make sure it reaches the roots. Water until it begins to drain from the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it drain:</strong> Never let your plant sit in standing water. Empty saucers after watering to avoid root rot.</li>
        <li><strong>Use room-temperature water:</strong> Cold water can shock the roots. Fill a watering can and let it sit for a bit before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust with the seasons:</strong> Plants grow more in spring and summer, so they drink more. In winter, they often need less water.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Light Basics</h2>
      <p>
        Light is food for plants — but not all plants need the same amount. Understanding how light works indoors can help you choose the right spot for each plant.
      </p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bright, indirect light:</strong> This is the sweet spot for most houseplants. A few feet from a sunny window (not in direct sun) is ideal.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct sunlight:</strong> Only sun-loving plants like succulents, cacti, and some herbs can handle full sun. Others may burn.</li>
        <li><strong>Low light:</strong> Rooms with small or north-facing windows still work for low-light plants like ZZ Plants, Snake Plants, or Pothos.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate regularly:</strong> Plants naturally grow toward the light. Rotating your plant weekly helps it grow evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean your windows and leaves:</strong> Dust blocks light! Make sure both your windows and the plant’s leaves are clean.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
      <p>
        Don’t rely too much on plant labels — “low light” doesn’t mean no light! Try moving your plant around and observing how it responds.
        A plant with pale, leggy growth might need more light, while one with scorched or curling leaves might need less.
