          <h3>Snake Plant (Sansevieria)</h3>
          <p>
            Known for its tall, upright leaves with striking green and yellow patterns, the snake plant is nearly indestructible.
            It thrives on neglect, needs minimal water, and tolerates low light. It is perfect for beginners or busy people.
            Bonus: it also helps clean indoor air!

        <div class="plant-info">
          <h3>Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)</h3>
          <p>
            With trailing vines and heart-shaped leaves, pothos is both beautiful and forgiving. It grows quickly, even in low light,
            and only needs water when the soil feels dry. Great for hanging baskets or shelves. Comes in several fun varieties like golden, marble, and neon!

        <div class="plant-info">
          <h3>ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)</h3>
          <p>
            Glossy dark green leaves and tough-as-nails nature make the ZZ plant a favorite. It tolerates low light, infrequent watering, and dry indoor air.
            It’s a great option for office spaces or low-light apartments.

        <div class="plant-info">
          <h3>Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)</h3>
          <p>
            Famous for its long arching leaves and adorable “baby” offshoots, the spider plant is super easy to care for.
            It adapts to a variety of light conditions, bounces back from missed waterings, and purifies the air.

      <div class="plant-card">
        <img src="images/lily.jpg" alt="Peace Lily">
        <div class="plant-info">
          <h3>Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)</h3>
          <p>
            Elegant white blooms and lush green leaves make the peace lily a stunning addition to any room. It prefers indirect light and moist soil—
            and it tells you when it’s thirsty by drooping slightly. Easy to care for and great for improving indoor air quality.
